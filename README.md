# Quick instructions on how to use this program:
1. LMB -> add vertex
2. RMB on a vertex allows you to mark it. Then you can add edges coming from the marked vertex by clicking LMB on other vertices.
3. If you want to delete a vertex mark it and then click the UsuÅ„ wierzchoÅ‚ek/Delete vertex button or Delete on your keyboard.
4. You can save your graph into a .graph file

I hope the rest of the features are pretty self-explanatory ğŸ˜€
